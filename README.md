# Employee Database
## Avado Enterprises Company Database

For this assignment, we were tasked with creating an employee database. This required the creation of a custom RESTful API from scratch as well as a front-end to view and update the database.

This was a fun and exciting assignment for me since this was our first hands-on experience creating an API from scratch and then using the skills we learned previously to query that database. I chose to develop a homepage and database for my own company, Avado Enterprises.

Technologies Used:

- React.js
- C#
- PostgreSQL
- Postman
- HTML
- CSS

- API deployed on Heroku
- Front-end developed using React.js
