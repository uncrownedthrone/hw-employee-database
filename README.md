# Employee Database
## Deployed on Netlify: https://js-employee-db.netlify.com

For this assignment, we were tasked with creating an employee database. This required the creation of a custom RESTful API from scratch as well as a front-end to view and update the database.

This was a fun and exciting assignment for me since this was our first hands-on experience creating an API from scratch and then using the skills we learned previously to query that database. I chose to develop a homepage and database for my own company, Avado Enterprises.
